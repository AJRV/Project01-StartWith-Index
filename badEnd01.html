  <h1><center>YOUR CORRUPTION KNOWS NO BOUNDS.</center></h1>
  <p>     I am sorry to inform you that you are amongst the most morally bankrupt people imaginable. It is not, however, cause for concern. Despite your current circumtances hope yet remains. For you we have procured the entirety of the script for 'It's A Wonderful Life'. If there is any hope to redeeming your soul, it lies within these sacred texts. Behold!</p>
  <p>note: Howdy, friend. If you're seeing this it means that the transcript has been removed. Now, don't you worry. It's not your fault. You see, we originally added the transcript after hearing that the film was public domain due to its commercial flop during its release. However, after googling the subject for a couple of minutes the issue seems a bit more complex than that. As such we have taken down the transcript while we find someone who is able to read legal mumbojumbo. </p>
