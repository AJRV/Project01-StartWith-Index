  <h1><center>KNIGHT OF THE FAITH</center></h1>
  <p>     Moral degradation? Not on your watch! You're . . . you're . . . Well, you scored really well. HUH? That's an anticlimactic answer? Listen, friend. I upheld my end of the bargain. You finished the test nice and proper and you got a title. Knight of the Faith. That's cool. Right? I mean, knights are cool. So, instead of being king meany pants you should be happy with your results.</p>
