	<h1><b>ALL ROADS, A TEST</b></h1>
	<p class="sacrifice"></p>
	
	<h2>I</h2>
	
	<p>The first question will help determine your pre-cognition and perception of the seemingly mundane. Although the temptation may be strong, we ask that you do not seek out the answers. This test works best if everythink you pick is dictated by the neurons of your brain-sponge, rather than what you find through 'research'.</p>
	<p>WHICH WAS THE <b>EIGHT</b> WORD ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE?</p>
	<input type="text" name="enlightment" placeholder="OPEN YOUR MIND.">
	<br><br>	<br><br>	<br><br>



	<h2>II</h2>
	<p> The second question will test your spirtial knowledge. Do not fear being wrong, for you will learn from your mistakes. Probably. Truth be told, we can't actually force you to learn anything. However, we really do recommend that you try learning something. We'd prefer you learn our teachings, but as long as you try to improve as person we can't really complain. HUH? Whaddoya mean that contradicts the the text on the previous question?</p>
	<p>WHAT IS THE SIGN OF THE CHOSEN ONE?</p>
	
	<input type="radio" name="chosen" value="0" checked>

	<label>THE CHOSEN ONE HAS NO SIGN, RATHER THEIR ACTIONS MARK THEIR STATUS</label><br>
	<br><br>	<br><br>	<br><br>



	<h2>III</h2>
	<p> You have reached the third question. If you squipped over any questions thus far we urge you to go back and answer them. We understand that this might be a highly stressful situation for you, but the test only works properly when taken in order. HUH? Why you ask? Well, it actually doesn't matter now that I think about it. Still, we would prefer that you do it in order. If you miss a question it could be awkward looking back through all the answers and trying to find which one you missed. Plus, you might be tempted to change an answer and that you misalign the results with your spiritual status. Anyways, this question test your. . . oh, gosh. I'm running out of space to write the questi</p>

	<label class="bluish">I appreciate your attempt to freshen up this quiz. Your passion really shows -- however I feel that violet or another color might better compliment the particular shade of Yellow that the background currently has. With that said, however, I just want to make it clear that I respect you as a person and understand if you disagree with my responce. Have a nice day.</label><br>

	<h2 class="redish">VII</h2>
	<p>I appreciate your honesty. I guess it's only fair that I should be honest with you too. The truth is that I'm not too sold on this whole cult thing. I mean, at first it sounded like fun, but after a while I realized that most of the answers where "Kung Pow: Enter the Fist" trivia and it made me feel like maybe I should reconsider my life choices. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie. It's just that I feel like there must be more to life. </p>
