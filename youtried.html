  <p>     Your impurities are clear. Darkness has taken a deep root within your heart. However, a small spark of light still remains. You are not without hope. Through your actions you may still find salvation. If you go now and buy a copy of "Kung Pow: Enter The Fist" you may yet save your mortal soul.</p>
  <p><b>HUH?</b>Whaddaya mean that is too short? Listen, bud. You try telling people to watch a good movie. They either do or they don't. I'm not going to sit here and be-- Oh, I'm sorry. That was out of line wasn't it? Um, how about this? I'll give you some extra text as an apology? Deal? Deal.</p>
